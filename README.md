To preprocess the data, I realized that there were a lot of columns that could be dropped because they wouldn't contribute valuably to the machine learning model. This especially included columns that had dates, strings, and mixed datatypes. Then, I made sure that all of the features I wanted to use were normalized and scaled properly to ease the optimization of the model. I based the y prediction to be based on if the home team or the away team was the winner of the game in the row. I then associated the team ID for the row to be based on if the team was the home team or the away team. I initially tried to do logistic regression, but realized thats only for categorical y data. I then tried linear regression but the accuracy of the model was consistently below 65%. I then tried random forest and got a high accuracy of 97%. So, I realized that the random forest algorithm would be the optimal model for this process.
